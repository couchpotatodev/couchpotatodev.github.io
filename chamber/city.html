        <p>It is known as the "Summer Capital of the Philippines", owing to its cool climate since the city is located approximately 4,810 feet (1,470 meters) above mean sea level.</p>
        <p>Baguio was established as a hill station by the United States in 1900 at the site of an Ibaloi village known as Kafagway.

        <h3>Demographics</h3>
        <p>The original inhabitants of the Baguio City area are the Ibaloi people (natively pronounced as "Ivadoi"). When the Americans established the city in the early 1900s, early settlers in the city include members of other Igorot tribes (Igudut in Ibaloi), the lowlander Ilocanos (Iduko), Americans (Merikano), and mestizos. A significant number of Chinese and Japanese laborers were also hired to build Kennon Road, many of whom later settled in the city.
